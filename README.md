# Kimura_2022_Rscripts
**Collection of R scripts for the analysis of ScRNAseq data**


**80hpl_3a3b_FACS_smartseq.R**
R script used to analyze the single cell rnaseq dataset generated after sorting via FACS that includes photoconverted (3a/3b progeny) and unphotoconverted (progeny of all other cells) at 80 hours post laying. 

**Embryo_Juv_URD_Trajectory.R**
R script used to perform trajectory inference analysis using the R package URD. The datasets used included embryonic cells and hatchling juvenile cells derived from (Hulett et. al., 2022).

**Embryonic_Hatchling_merged_UMAP.R**
R script used to merge both embryonic and hatchling datasets to generate a UMAP embedding containing datasets that spanned the majority of embryonic development until hatching. 

**Hatchling_3a3b_FACS_smartseq.R**
R script used to analyze the single cell rnaseq dataset generated after sorting via FACS that includes photoconverted 3a/3b progeny) and unphotoconverted (progeny of all other cells) at hatching.
